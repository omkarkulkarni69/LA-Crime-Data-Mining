📂 Code Structure & Files
📌 Python Notebooks
1️⃣ DM_Part-1.ipynb
Purpose: Data exploration, cleaning, and feature engineering.
Contents:
✔️ Data preprocessing (handling missing values, feature extraction).
✔️ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
✔️ Initial insights on crime frequency and victim demographics.
📌 Usage: Run this first to prepare the dataset before applying machine learning models.

2️⃣ FirstModel.ipynb
Purpose: Implementation of Logistic Regression and evaluation metrics.
Contents:
✔️ Logistic Regression for crime type classification.
✔️ Performance evaluation (confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
📌 Usage: Use this to test Logistic Regression on the dataset.

3️⃣ SecondModel.ipynb
Purpose: Implementation of Decision Tree classification with confusion matrix analysis.
Contents:
✔️ Decision Tree Classifier to predict crime categories.
✔️ Aggregated confusion matrix for model performance comparison.
📌 Usage: Builds on FirstModel, adding Decision Tree and deeper evaluation.

4️⃣ FourthModel.ipynb
Purpose: DBSCAN clustering for identifying crime hotspots.
Contents:
✔️ DBSCAN clustering implementation on crime data.
✔️ Identifies high-crime zones based on density.
📌 Usage: Dedicated notebook for DBSCAN clustering.

5️⃣ K_Means_Algorithm (1).ipynb
Purpose: Dedicated notebook for K-Means clustering analysis.
Contents:
✔️ Finding the optimal number of clusters (Elbow Method).
✔️ Crime clustering based on spatial and temporal patterns.
📌 Usage: Used specifically for clustering analysis.

6️⃣ DBSCAN_Trial.ipynb
Purpose: Experimentation with DBSCAN clustering.
Contents:
✔️ Testing different epsilon (ε) and min-sample values.
✔️ Crime cluster visualization on LA city map.
📌 Usage: Used to explore non-linear crime clusters.
